    <h1>[Star-Wars Character Page]</h1>
    <p id="sw-paragraph-1">
        This page will highlight the indivdual abilities of Anakin and Obi-Wan, which will be next to their respective photos as the wireframe
        outline depicts. It will highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and, for the purposes of this page one main strength and one main
        weakness against their opponent.
        </p>
        <p id="sw-paragraph-2">
        Anakin is the more offensive character. He specializes in going on the attack, with quick and aggressive moves that tend to put most of
        his opponents on the defensive. He has very strong force abilities, which also give him a raw temporary advantage on those who don't see
        it coming.
    </p>
    <p id="sw-paragraph-1">
        Obi-Wan is the more defensive character. He is very effective when he is able to draw in his opponents, even being able to handle multiple
        foes for a short time. His force abilities aren't as strong as Anakins, but they are still effective when they need to be, albeit less 
        frequently.
