        Anakin is the more offensive character. He specializes in going on the attack, with quick and aggressive moves that tend to put most of
        his opponents on the defensive. He has very strong force abilities, which also give him a raw temporary advantage on those who don't see
        it coming. In the case of this matchup, he would offer a good counter to Iron man's fast ranged attacks, but wouldn't do well against
        Captian Americas fighting stlye + moveset.
      </p>
    <p id="sw-paragraph-2">
        Obi-Wan is the more defensive character. He is very effective when he is able to draw in his opponents, even being able to handle multiple
        foes for a short time. His force abilities aren't as strong as Anakins, but they are still effective when they need to be, albeit less 
        frequently. In the case of this matchup, he would offer a good counter to Captain America's moveset and block most of his attacks, but wouldn't
        do well vs Iron Man's ranged attacks.
    </p>
    <p id="sw-paragraph-3">
        Anakin and Obi-Wan form quite the duo together. They have fought and trained together for almsot double the time their opponents have known each
        other. This offers them a unique advantage due to their ability to work well as a team, anticipate not only what their opponents will do but what
        the other person will do and how to compliment it!
