        <h3>[Main page description]</h3>
        <p id="Home-Paragraph-1">
            This is a fun site that will dive into a fun what-if scnario to see who would win in a fight, 
            Anakin + Obi-Wan or Iron Man + Captian America? We will go over all of the necessary considerations,
            the rules, the setting, Equipment, the variants of the Characters being used (mainly on the Marvel side),
            and decide on which team would win.
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-2">
            The Rules are to provide a relatively fair fight, but in order to make this plausible we gotta give
            the Marvel Characters a bit of a "buff" so that they don't get slowly lose limbs to lightsabers.
            On the other hand, we can't just have the Jedi casually force choking the Marvel Heros before the fight
            even starts, so that's out of the picture (they can still use the force for basically anything else though).
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-3">
            As far as equipment goes, we are assuming Captain Americas shield can withstand an infinite amount of lightsaber 
            strikes, as well as Iron Man's suit being resistant to most strikes, but can break after a few hits. The Jedi 
            will just have their lightsabers.
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-4">
            This fight will take place on Earth in a generic rundown arena, with plenty of debris and a few 3rd party contenders
            that may sneak into the battle.
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-5">
            Some considerations to score the fight will be the stregth of their abilities not straight up offering a "1 shot"
            (Neither side can use 1 move and call it a day), but some attacks would be considered stronger than others. Both sides
            will have a low tier attack, mid tier attack, and high tier attack. They will add up point wise and then be compared to 
            see which team would come out on top!
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-6">
            What makes this site different is up to the interpertation of the indivdual. I can't really imagine this site is the only One
            in the world to consider this what if scnario, but I'd be willing to bet the circumstances and considerations are relatively
            unique / haven't been fully considered by others.
          </p>
          <p id="Home-Paragraph-7">
            The variants of the Characters used will be the standard Characters that we see in the movies, including any and all abilities
            seen, but does not include abilities they have in other things like books or something.
