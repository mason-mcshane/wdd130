        This is a fun site that will dive into a fun what-if scnario to see who would win in a fight, 
        Anakin + Obi-Wan or Iron Man + Captian America? We will go over all of the necessary considerations,
        the rules, the setting, Equipment, the variants of the Characters being used (mainly on the Marvel side),
        and decide on which team would win.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Rules are to provide a relatively fair fight, but in order to make this plausible we gotta give
        the Marvel Characters a bit of a "buff" so that they don't get slowly lose limbs to lightsabers.
        On the other hand, we can't just have the Jedi casually force choking the Marvel Heros before the fight
        even starts, so that's out of the picture (they can still use the force for basically anything else though).
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as equipment goes, we are assuming Captain Americas shield can withstand an infinite amount of lightsaber 
        strikes, as well as Iron Man's suit being resistant to most strikes, but can break after a few hits. The Jedi 
        will just have their lightsabers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This fight will take place on Earth in a generic rundown arena, with plenty of debris and a few 3rd party contenders
        that may sneak into the battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some considerations to score the fight will be the stregth of their abilities not straight up offering a "1 shot"
        (Neither side can use 1 move and call it a day), but some attacks would be considered stronger than others. Both sides
        will have a low tier attack, mid tier attack, and high tier attack. They will add up point wise and then be compared to 
        see which team would come out on top!
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this site different is up to the interpertation of the indivdual. I can't really imagine this site is the only One
        in the world to consider this what if scnario, but I'd be willing to bet the circumstances and considerations are relatively
        unique / haven't been fully considered by others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The variants of the Characters used will be the standard Characters that we see in the movies, including any and all abilities
        seen, but does not include abilities they have in other things like books or something.

      <h3>[Star Wars Character Description]</h3>
      <p>
        This page will highlight the indivdual abilities of Anakin and Obi-Wan, which will be next to their respective photos as the wireframe
        outline depicts. It will highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and, for the purposes of this page one main strength and one main
        weakness against their opponent.
        </p>
        <p>Anakin is the more offensive character. He specializes in going on the attack, with quick and aggressive moves that tend to put most of
        his opponents on the defensive. He has very strong force abilities, which also give him a raw temporary advantage on those who don't see
        it coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obi-Wan is the more defensive character. He is very effective when he is able to draw in his opponents, even being able to handle multiple
        foes for a short time. His force abilities aren't as strong as Anakins, but they are still effective when they need to be, albeit less 
        frequently.

        This page will highlight the indivdual abilities of Iron Man and Captian America, which will be next to their respective photos as the
        wireframe outline depicts. It will highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and, for the purposes of this page one main strength and one main
        weakness against their opponent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iron Man is the more offensive Character of this pair. He has a lot of quick barrage style attacks that come from his suit which can be lethal
        if he is to use them at the correct time. He also has the ability to fly, but for the sake of this matchup, not very far, high, or for very long
        periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Captian America is the more defensive Character of this pair, but he has extremely efficient shield usage. for the purposes of this website we are
       assuming that his shield can withstand any lightsaber strike and that he can summon it back at any time. He also has a good amount of raw strength 
       that would be a soild contender to that of Anakins strong abilites.
