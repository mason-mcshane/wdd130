      This page will highlight the indivdual abilities of Iron Man and Captian America, which will be next to their respective photos as the
      wireframe outline depicts. It will highlight their strengths and weaknesses, and, for the purposes of this page one main strength and one main
      weakness against their opponent.

    <p id="marvel-paragraph-2">
      Iron Man is the more offensive Character of this pair. He has a lot of quick barrage style attacks that come from his suit which can be lethal
      if he is to use them at the correct time. He also has the ability to fly, but for the sake of this matchup, not very far, high, or for very long
      periods of time.
    </p>
    <p id="marvel-paragraph-3">
     Captian America is the more defensive Character of this pair, but he has extremely efficient shield usage. for the purposes of this website we are
     assuming that his shield can withstand any lightsaber strike and that he can summon it back at any time. He also has a good amount of raw strength 
     that would be a soild contender to that of Anakins strong abilites.
