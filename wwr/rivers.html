            Located deep within the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return is the Salmon River. Many years ago,
            it was lovingly named the "River of No Return" by the locals. This was due to the fact that numerous
            tourists were drawn to the river's wild charm and found it difficult to depart.<br><br>
            
            The rapids should not be overlooked! The river flows freely, so in the early summer it's higher, faster, and colder,
            and in the late summer it is lower, slower, and milder. Families with swimming-loving kids tend to value
            the slower, warmer water in the late summer more.<br><br>

                The Green River travels toward the vast Colorado River and the sea while winding through gorges in central Utah,
                some of the most barren country on earth. This stream is well-known for its enormous rapids, stunning desert landscape,
                and high grey stone cliffs.<br><br> 
                
                This 84-mile journey from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid, which is located just outside of 
                Green River, Utah, offers fantastic whitewater chances, intriguing geologic formations, and proof of prehistoric and
                historic human activity.<br><br>
