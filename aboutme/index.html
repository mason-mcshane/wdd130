    <p>Hello! I am from Richland WA, I served my mission in Tempe Arizona, 
     and I very much consider myself a jack of all trades with how much variety
     there is in what I enjoy doing.</p>
    <p>I am currently studying Software Engineering and I look forward to this
    class because much of what we will learn about is right up the alley of what
    i've always wanted to do with programming.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church all my life and couldn't imagine having
    grown up any other way. My favorite conference talk is "Safety for the Soul"
    By Elder (Now President) Holland.</p>
